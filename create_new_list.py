"""Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that
   contains each number of lst at most N times without reordering.

   For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2],
   drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times,
   and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3]."""
